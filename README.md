# Complete Custom Navigation Programmatic
# UI Navigation Controller
They are core components in how most apps navigates from screen to screen

# What are they?
Navigation Controller is not a screen on its own, it’s just a container that holds View Controllers (stack of screens)
 
# How do they work?
As you navigate through your screens, you are pushing new screens on top of the stack and as you go back, you are popping that screen off the stack.

# How to fit in best in your app?
The Root View Controller is the very bottom screen of your stack that is embedded on Navigation VC. As you add another screen, they go on top of the Root VC and so forth.

# How do we navigate
We can navigate from one VC to the next by the following methods:

1. Show
2. Present Modally
3. Perform Segue
4. Storyboard

I have used UINavigationBar to display my app’s navigational controls in a bar along the top of the iOS device’s screen.
UINavigationBar enables us to design a distinctive navigation bar that matches any app’s design and creates intuitive 
interaction for users.

This sample code project demonstrates how to use UINavigationController and UIViewController classes 
as building blocks in my application’s user interface.

I have wrote a custom code to set standardAppearance, scrollEdgeAppearance and compactAppearance
