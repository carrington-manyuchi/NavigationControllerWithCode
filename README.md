# Complete Custom Navigation Programmatic

I have used UINavigationBar to display my app’s navigational controls in a bar along the top of the iOS device’s screen.
UINavigationBar enables us to design a distinctive navigation bar that matches any app’s design and creates intuitive 
interaction for users.

This sample code project demonstrates how to use UINavigationController and UIViewController classes 
as building blocks in my application’s user interface.

I have wrote a custom code to set standardAppearance, scrollEdgeAppearance and compactAppearance
